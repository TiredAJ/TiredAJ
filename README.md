- Hi, I’m @TiredAJ, or just AJ
- I’m interested in computers and chocolate
- I primarily work in C# and C++
- I'm kinda interested in learning C (for RaspberryPI and Arduino stuff), (relearning) Lua and maybe (maybe) Java
- You can reach me here: aletha.e.jones@gmail.com

Here I'll largely focus on my personal projects such as [AJGraphicsEngine](https://github.com/TiredAJ/AJGraphicsEngine)

I'm not sure if I'm using GitHub right, but, we're making progress
