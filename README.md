1st year Msc Comp-sci student that loves to mess around with computers and coding. I go by AJ & they/them. 

I primarily work in C#, but I do have some C++ projects. I'm currently learning Rust & relearning Lua and have interest in learning C properly and some Java. I also have an Arduino Uno, two Pi 3B+'s and a couple of cables :3

Comms stuff in the works
